# mAh Battery

Adds a mAh (milliampere-hours) battery level indicator to the Mac bar.

This meme was created by the 4:00 AM gang.

By the way this is totally a joke, it's the first thing I ever wrote in Swift.

## How Do I Use It?

- Prerequisites: 
    - XCode
    - A MacBook
    - ~~a will to live~~

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in XCode.
3. Press `âŒ˜ R` (Command + `R`) to run, or use the Build option from the menu.
4. Install the generated `.app` file into your `Applications` folder.
5. Go to `System Preferences` > `Users and Groups` > `Login Items`, click `+`, and add the app.
6. Hold `âŒ˜` and drag the little thing to wherever your little heart desires.

## Why Does this Exist?

Why does anything exist? *Does* anything exist? ðŸ¤”

## How Does it Work?

Poorly.

JK. It works pretty well. It's very simple, too:

I blatantly copied some code from God-knows-where and put it in `Battery.swift`, then wrote the `BatteryAPI` as a completely
un-necessary frivolity to interface with it, with a series of highly complicated and useful functions such as:

```swift
func isCharging() -> String {
    return String(battery.isCharging());
}
```

<sub><sup>Yeah that's right. I use semicolons in Swift.</sup></sub>

Oooh. Aaah.

Basically it's a bunch of `menuitems` with an update function that does this:

```swift
statusItem.button?.title = batteryApi.currentCapacity(unit: true);
currentCapacityOutlet.title = "Current Capacity: " + batteryApi.currentCapacity();
maxCapacityOutlet.title = "Maximum Capacity: " + batteryApi.maxCapacity();
...
```

On a timer that looks like this:

```swift
Timer.scheduledTimer(
    timeInterval: 5, 
    target: self, 
    selector: #selector(StatusMenuController.timerFire), 
    userInfo: nil, 
    repeats: true
);
```

Nah. I mean, if you really want to, I won't stop you. But there are probably many better things to do with your time.
